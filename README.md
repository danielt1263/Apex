# Apex
A Swift model management library with async capability built in.

Apex is designed to help you archetect your app in a declarative manor with a clear sepration between the logic of the app and the effects.

This is accomplished by imagining your app as a [Moore type State Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore_machine)
